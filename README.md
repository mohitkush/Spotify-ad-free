# Spotify-ad-free
The spotify ad-free.py file contains a python code which simply turns off the volume as soon as the code finds an ad playing.
The code uses three main libraries selenium, BeautifulSoup and pycaw, if you don't have these libraries installed, don't worry the code will install them, just be sure to add python to PATH.
It also requires chrome driver, which it automatically downloads.
